Dear [Investor],

We would like to introduce you to Census, an innovative venture that is revolutionizing the data activation space and stands poised for remarkable growth. We are currently opening a new round of funding and believe that your expertise and network would make you an invaluable partner in our ongoing success.

In an era where data is the new currency, Census is uniquely positioned as the #1 Data Activation platform, powered by Reverse ETL technology. We transform data warehouses into a hub for marketing and business operations, eliminating the need for custom scripts and engineering support. With Census, marketers can directly access and leverage trusted data, resulting in smarter business decisions and improved outcomes. 

Companies like Sonos, Canva, Orangetheory Fitness, Fivetran, Figma, and Notion leverage our platform to synchronize their customer data, which has led to stunning results - reducing Customer Acquisition Costs by 50%, personalizing marketing for 125 million users, and reducing support times by 98%. 

Our team is boasting an impressive array of influential advisors and leaders in the tech industry, with top-tier talent hailing from companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Airbnb, along with graduates from eminent universities such as Harvard, Yale, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of California, Berkeley. Our operational and strategic leadership has been instrumental in our current accomplishments- a team that would benefit immensely from your backing and guidance.

Already backed by reputable firms like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners, Tiger Global Management, etc., Census has secured $80.3 million in funding so far. We believe a partnership with you will further bolster our momentum as we continue pioneering data-driven innovation.

Would you be open to setting up a meeting to discuss the investment opportunity? We'd love the chance to share more about Census and explore how your participation could play a defining role in the story of our growth.
