At insitro, we are rethinking the entire drug discovery process, from the perspective of machine learning, human genetics, and high-throughput, quantitative biology. Over the past five decades, we have seen the development of new medicines becoming increasingly more difficult and expensive, leaving many patients with significant unmet need. We’re embarking on a new approach to drug development – one that leverages machine learning and unique in vitro strategies for modeling disease state and designing new therapeutic interventions. We aim to eliminate key bottlenecks in traditional drug discovery, so we can help more people sooner and at a much lower cost to the patient and the healthcare industry. We believe that by harnessing the power of technology to interrogate and measure human biology, we can have a major impact on many diseases. We invest heavily in cutting edge bioengineering technologies to enable the construction of large-scale, high-quality data sets that are designed specifically to drive machine learning methods. Our first application is to use human genetics, functional genomics, and machine learning to build a new generation of in vitro human cell-derived disease models whose response to perturbation is designed to be predictive of human clinical outcomes. This cannot be done without great people. We are bringing together an outstanding team of people whose expertise spans multiple disciplines - life sciences, machine learning, human genetics, engineering, and drug discovery - and building a unique culture where people from diverse backgrounds work as a single team towards a common goal. We offer opportunities to collaborative people with expertise in life science and computational science. Join us to help bring better health to more people, faster and cheaper.",Eugeni Vaisberg (https://linkedin.com/in/eugeni-vaisberg); Perry Palmedo (https://linkedin.com/in/perry-palmedo-9005825); Matthew Rasmussen (https://linkedin.com/in/mattrasmus); Daphne Koller (https://linkedin.com/in/daphne-koller-4053a820); Jason Ravenel (https://linkedin.com/in/jason-d-ravenel); Philip Tagari (https://linkedin.com/in/philip-tagari-793719b); Serafim Batzoglou (https://linkedin.com/pub/serafim-batzoglou/0/148/89a); Keith James (https://linkedin.com/in/keith-james-129b343); Eddie Ray Watts (https://linkedin.com/in/eddie-ray-watts-51b6745); Ellen Berg (https://linkedin.com/in/ellenbergaltopredict); David Lloyd (https://linkedin.com/in/david-lloyd-4b78177); Serafim Batzoglou (https://linkedin.com/in/serafim-batzoglou-89a148),,https://linkedin.com/in/eugeni-vaisberg; https://linkedin.com/in/perry-palmedo-9005825; https://linkedin.com/in/mattrasmus; https://linkedin.com/in/daphne-koller-4053a820; https://linkedin.com/in/jason-d-ravenel; https://linkedin.com/in/philip-tagari-793719b; https://linkedin.com/pub/serafim-batzoglou/0/148/89a; https://linkedin.com/in/keith-james-129b343; https://linkedin.com/in/eddie-ray-watts-51b6745; https://linkedin.com/in/ellenbergaltopredict; https://linkedin.com/in/david-lloyd-4b78177; https://linkedin.com/in/serafim-batzoglou-89a148,252,9.090909091,California,United States,1/1/2018,"Life sciences & healthcare (Tag Type: Market Vertical, Date Added: 03/30/2023); Artificial intelligence (Tag Type: Technology Type, Date Added: 03/30/2023); Data Analytics (Tag Type: Technology Type, Date Added: 03/30/2023)",STARTUP,https://insitro.com,https://linkedin.com/company/insitro,4,3/15/2021,Series C,400000000,743000000,,"T.

These solutions work together via APIs to deliver content and digital experiences to customers in a more agile and flexible way than a single, integrated, and essentially monolithic platform. It brings a microservices approach to the DXP space. Our composable DXP stands out in the market, so your digital experiences can. The Contentstack platform builds on our pioneering headless CMS roots, making complete what headless CMS alone do not. This includes a built-in Marketplace, full-stack automation, and integrated front-end hosting for full end-to-end digital experience functionality. Unlike legacy DXP solutions, we do this with a 100% open MACH architecture for maximum choice and functionality up and down the composable stack. There is no stack like Contentstack.

Lively was created because we saw through firsthand experience what it means to sacrifice your personal health due to your financial health. We knew there had to be a better way to afford these rising costs and discovered how powerful the Health Savings Account (HSA) is to not only save on the costs of healthcare today, but plan for the costs of tomorrow. Healthcare is complicated, your HSA doesn’t have to be. We create beautifully designed software with a simple and intuitive user experience to help you get the most out of your HSA.

It has become India's leading business management app for MSMEs with 13 languages & 50M+ downloads in a remarkably short period of time. Founded by four IIT-Bombay alumni, Khatabook is led by Ravish Naresh, Co-founder and COO Housing.com, along with Dhanesh Kumar, Ashish Sonone and Jaideep Poonia. Khatabook enables micro, small and medium merchants to track business transactions safely and securely. It also offers features such as online payment collection through UPI and QR; sending periodic reminders to creditors via messages and report generation. Thanks to this and more. Our latest feature is an automated bot call reminder feature known as Interactive Voice Response. This is a first of it's kind feature that simplifies merchants' credit collection and allows them to better function in the MSME Business Sector. It's one of the many examples of how our tech acts as an equalizer of opportunity. Today, Khatabook has become a household name. Merchants are using the app extensively while adding $200 Million worth of transactions every day. The high-engagement has resulted in more than 25% of the total active merchants joining the platform through word-of-mouth and referrals. Our users recovered billions stuck in credit in six months, significantly impacting India’s MSME sector. We also recently closed a $60 Million Series C Round (after a $25 Million Series A round in 2019 and Series B Round soon after) and are backed by the top investors in the business. As a team that is working round the clock to make our users’ experience better, we are the best fit for professionals who are dedicated towards putting their best foot forward and are open to learning and growing together.

If we had our way, we'd live in a world where we're mindful about how we consume, we love every product we own, and we share values with the brands who create them. In reality, commerce isn't perfect and often breaks. Loop creates second chances. We're starting by revolutionizing the post-purchase experience. We've taken one of the most fragile commerce interactions - returns - and turned it into something consumers actually love, and that deepens our connection to brands and products. We take connection seriously on the inside, too. We're building a work experience that allows you to Be A Human First and prioritizes empathy and wellbeing. We view Loop as a special place in your career to shape the future of an industry and become a better person while doing it.

When Gnosis was founded in 2015, it focused on building prediction markets to enable worldwide access to accurate information. Today, as a DAO, Gnosis uses the products that it creates to transparently guide decisions on the development, support, and governance of its ecosystem. Safe, Cow Protocol, Conditional Tokens, Gnosis Auction, Zodiac, Agnostic Relay, and MEV Blocker are all products and protocols incubated by Gnosis. In November 2021, the xDai and GnosisDAO communities voted to combine their vibrant ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain, an EVM compatible, community owned network that prioritizes credible neutrality. Secured by over 125k validators around the world, Gnosis Chain ensures a secure and resilient infrastructure. Users and developers on Gnosis Chain can also take advantage of familiar tooling and trust-minimized bridges to the Ethereum mainnet. Gnosis Chain employs the same execution and consensus layer clients as Ethereum, ensuring seamless integration with all future EIPs. Most recently, we launched Gnosis Pay, the first decentralized payment network allowing web3 developers to integrate with a range of traditional payment schemes including Visa. Gnosis Pay allows users to spend their digital assets anywhere Visa is accepted with the same quick, seamless transactions they expect from a traditional debit card. Embrace the future of decentralized technology with Gnosis Chain, and join us as we continue to shape the next generation of web3 advancements. Together, we are building a decentralized ecosystem that empowers users and fosters global innovation.",mauro Delea (https://linkedin.com/in/mauro-delea-8961a3169); Dr. Friederike Ernst (https://linkedin.com/in/friederikeernst); Martin Köppelmann (https://linkedin.com/in/koeppelmann); Matt Liston (https://linkedin.com/in/matt-liston-b041088a); Theo Heselmans (https://linkedin.com/in/theoheselmans); Olga Grinina (https://linkedin.com/in/olga-grinina-2939a631); Stefan George (https://linkedin.com/in/stefangeorge); Steven Borg (https://linkedin.com/in/steven-borg-8a926341),,https://linkedin.com/in/mauro-delea-8961a3169; https://linkedin.com/in/friederikeernst; https://linkedin.com/in/koeppelmann; https://linkedin.com/in/matt-liston-b041088a; https://linkedin.com/in/theoheselmans; https://linkedin.com/in/olga-grinina-2939a631; https://linkedin.com/in/stefangeorge; https://linkedin.com/in/steven-borg-8a926341,121,45.78313253,Berlin,Germany,1/1/2017,"Communications and information technology (Tag Type: Market Vertical, Date Added: 03/30/2023); Blockchain (Tag Type: Technology Type, Date Added: 03/30/2023)",STARTUP,https://gnosis.io,https://linkedin.com/company/gnosis-limited,3,7/14/2022,Venture - Series Unknown,100000000,113000000,,CMCC Global; AscendEX; Greenfield Capital ; NGC Ventures; Blockchain Capital; Signum Capital ; ParaFi Capital; Digital Currency Group; Kenetic; Collider; Consensys Mesh; G2H2 Capital; BAIC Capital; Fosun 复星; 比心陪练; IOSG Ventures; RockawayX; BlockAsset; Philosophia Capital; Tiger Global Management; Focus Labs; Cherry Crypto; Polymorphic Capital; Lightspeed Financial Services Group; Hack VC; 1kx; James Sowers,,,info@gnosis.pm,aurynmacmillan@gmail.com; alexxherrmann@live.com; beth@starfish.network,https://twitter.com/gnosischain,@gnosischain,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gnosis,https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/229320-01,,https://www.facebook.com/gnosis.pm,https://angel.co/company/gnosis-1,,

We purchase veterinary practices and provide operational support to relieve administrative burdens such as payroll, recruiting, HR, marketing and accounts payables. If needed, we invest to support growth. The practices maintain their unique branding, culture and clinical autonomy. At Heartland, we believe that selling a veterinary practice shouldn’t mean losing what makes it remarkable. When we acquire a practice, the doctor comes first. We listen closely to their needs in order to create a one-of-a-kind solution to ease their administrative burdens—all without disrupting their day-to-day operations, the culture they’ve fostered, and the relationships they’ve built. In other words, the name over the door doesn’t go away. The headaches of running a business do. Partnering veterinarians appreciate an improved work-life balance, less financial worry, and the confidence that their teams will be in good hands. Best of all, they get to focus on why they entered the business in the first place: to care for animals and to be present when their clients need them most. Practice team members enjoy the warm culture of their individual community practices combined with the support and resources that Heartland brings to the table. Improving the lives of veterinarians means supporting them at all stages of their careers. Whether you're a veterinary student or a new graduate looking for hands-on learning to begin your career or an experienced veterinarian looking to tackle management and leadership opportunities, we keep your goals at the heart of everything we do. The Heartland Support Center team is hardwired to serve. We follow the philosophy of servant leadership and put the needs of others first with a genuine desire to help. As a result, Heartland’s practices count on team members to be there for them with heart and solution, not a corporate agenda.","Jessi Farris, DVM, MBA (https://linkedin.com/in/jessifarrisdvm); Scot Swisher (https://linkedin.com/in/scot-swisher-2521bba0); Adam C.

We stand out from the rest of the retail industry with our strong marketing intelligence, supply chain and distribution channels, outstanding customer support and experience in brick-and-mortar stores, online and catalog sales.","Tracy Furrier (https://linkedin.com/in/tracyfurrier); Michael Arthur, CFA, CPA (https://linkedin.com/in/michael-arthur-cfa-cpa); Michael Nelson (https://linkedin.com/in/michaelnelson01); Kurt Kappeler (https://linkedin.com/in/kurt-kappeler-8a417551); Michael Arthur, CFA, CPA (https://linkedin.com/in/michael-arthur-cfa-cpa-b52aa81b); Colin Umphreys (https://linkedin.com/in/colin-umphreys-4412b016); Melinda McPherson CPA (https://linkedin.com/in/melinda-mcpherson-cpa-88b17128); Kelley Cybul (https://linkedin.com/in/kelley-cybul-8a28753b); Justin Yoshimura (https://linkedin.com/in/yoshimuraj); Tom Baron (https://linkedin.com/in/tom-baron-03b2737); Pat Burbach (https://linkedin.com/in/pat-burbach-758b3121); Vice President HR Generation Katerina Gerdeman CSC (https://linkedin.com/in/katerinahr); Mokshika Sharma (https://linkedin.com/in/mokshika-sharma-68614418); Scott Fretheim (https://linkedin.com/in/scott-fretheim-4892971b); Jeremy Baker (https://linkedin.com/in/jeremy-baker-57281911); Elizabeth Sheyn Brown (https://linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-sheyn-brown-06286722); Frank L.

Bucking convention and driven by a passion to create the ultimate gaming experience, Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian founded 1047 Games in 2017 in their Stanford dorm room. Their love for arena shooters of the past drove them to create Splitgate, a unique sci-fi first-person shooter that adds portal guns to upend the genre. What started as two computer science majors putting portals into a first-person shooter for a project demo has evolved into a VC-backed company which has raised more than $120MM in funding. At 1047 Games, you’ll find a permanently remote, dedicated team of top-tier talent from some of the world’s biggest gaming and tech companies who share our founders’ vision. Grit, ingenuity, a desire to have fun, and a start up mentality define our crew.

Over geological timescales, carbon dioxide in the air and water chemically bind to these minerals and permanently turn to stone. Our technology enhances this natural process, called carbon mineralization, to help minerals absorb CO2 from the ambient air in days, rather than years. By combining the best of engineering and nature, we can offer the most cost-effective and scalable Direct Air Capture solution in the world.",Matt Barnard (https://linkedin.com/in/mattbarnard); Noah McQueen (https://linkedin.com/in/noahmcqueen); Shashank Samala (https://linkedin.com/in/shashanksamala),,https://linkedin.com/in/mattbarnard; https://linkedin.com/in/noahmcqueen; https://linkedin.com/in/shashanksamala,127,60.75949367,California,United States,1/1/2020,"Data Analytics (Tag Type: Technology Type, Date Added: 03/30/2023); Energy and utilities (Tag Type: Market Vertical, Date Added: 03/30/2023)",STARTUP,http://heirloomcarbon.com,https://linkedin.com/company/heirloom-carbon,4,4/22/2022,Grant,Undisclosed,54300000,,Musk Foundation; Lowercarbon Capital; XPRIZE; Yes VC; Carbon Removal Partners; Prelude Ventures; The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; Global Reserve Group; National Science Foundation (NSF); Quantum Capital Management; Carbon Direct Capital; Time Ventures; Breyer Capital; Seven Seven Six 7️⃣7️⃣6️⃣; Incite.org; AENU; TIME Ventures; Breakthrough Energy ; Carbon Direct; Tin Shed Ventures; Ahren Innovation Capital,Business (B2B),,hello@heirloomcarbon.com,mattbarnard@ymail.com; barnard.matt@gmail.com; lmolinaro2014@kellogg.northwestern.edu; mrs42008@mymail.pomona.edu; max.scholten@gmail.com; brendan.andersen@cybercoders.com; brendan@aimdup.com; brendan@cybercoders.com; shashi77@gmail.com,https://twitter.com/heirloomcarbon,@heirloomcarbon,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/heirloom-d756,https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/465600-25,,,https://angel.co/company/heirloom-7,,

With no hard credit check to get started, Self's signature Credit Builder Account and secured Self Visa® Credit Card issued by partner banks are designed to enable people to build credit in a way that can fit their budgets. The company also offers rent and utility payment reporting, which enables customers to get credit for bills they already pay, like rent, cell phone plan, and utilities. Download the Self app on the Apple App Store (220,000+ reviews and an average 4.9 rating!) or Google Play or visit Self.inc for more information. Follow Self on Instagram ,TikTok @selffinancial, and LinkedIn, or like us on Facebook. How Self started CEO James Garvey founded Self in 2015 after making a mistake with automatic payments on his credit card. By the time he caught it, his credit score had tanked. In searching for a way to rebuild his credit, he saw some of the challenges faced by millions and millions of Americans with low or no credit. James found that to get credit, you need credit. It’s a catch-22, and the system is set up against many people. He created a solution that works regardless of credit history or bank balance. Self now offers the Credit Builder Account, the Self Visa® Credit Card, and rent and bills reporting — all different tools for building credit and positive financial habits. Mission: We believe everyone should have the opportunity to improve their financial future. We exist to enable people to build credit, save money, and reach their goals.","Sam Hernandez (https://linkedin.com/in/sam-hernandez-b750a615); Bill Butler (https://linkedin.com/in/bill-butler-044800213); Matthew Briggs (https://linkedin.com/in/matthew-briggs-aba93110); Brian Vitone, CRCM, CAMS, CFE (https://linkedin.com/in/brianvitone); Nicholas Shiffert (https://linkedin.com/in/nshiffert); Chris LaConte (https://linkedin.com/in/chrislaconte); Elizabeth O.

Unfortunately, plastic-based wet wipes have become a critical problem plaguing waterways, landfills, and sewage pipes. They contribute to 90% of sewer blockages, as most wipes aren't truly flushable - even the ones that claim to be. These blockages cost £100 million, in the UK alone, to break apart each year. Twipes are bringing clean change to a dirty industry – we create the world's first truly flushable and biodegradable wet wipes! They disperse in water in 3 hours and biodegrade in landfill in just 7 days. They’re plastic-free, alcohol-free, and paraben-free - dermatologist-tested to be as safe on skin as they are for the planet. Twipes are designed to be fully dispersed before they reach main sewer drains to avoid creating blockages. Our natural-fibre formulation biodegrades quickly – never ending up on beaches or riverbeds. We believe living sustainably should be affordable and easy – as simple as changing your product.

As of Q2 2023, we have provided over 125 million units of essential medicines to hospitals, enough to help treat over 50 million patients. Recently, we announced we will manufacture and distribute affordable medications for consumers in an outpatient/retail setting, including affordable insulin. Insulin is an exciting project as we are partnering with nearly every corner of the diabetes ecosystem to bring low-cost insulin to people living with diabetes at no more than $30 a vial and no more than $55 for a pack of five pre-filled pens, regardless of insurance status. WHY CIVICA? Because patients should have the essential medicines they need when they need them.

Through a direct-to-consumer approach, Mona Lee’s AI-powered self-serve platform transforms the consumer solar buying experience by eliminating non-stop solicitation calls, lengthy design and evaluation processes, and back-and-forth price negotiations that can take up to weeks. With Mona Lee Solar, customers go from quote to system design in seconds. Mona Lee Solar was founded by a group of serial entrepreneurs with decades of experience in clean energy. The company is headquartered in Boston, MA and is proud to serve homeowners nationwide. Up until now, buying solar as a residential customer was like buying a car from a used car salesman – opaque pricing, drawn-out process, and aggressive salespeople. We know, because we were a part of it for almost a decade. After leading sales and marketing across top solar companies, like SolarCity (acquired in 2016 by a little company named Tesla), we got to know the ins and outs of how the solar business worked, and we paid particular attention to the pain points customers were experiencing. Curious about the real experiences of homeowners who have embraced Mona Lee Solar? Feel free to visit our website to browse Mona Lee reviews and discover firsthand accounts of our transformative solar solution.

Onchain marketing allows for a more effective engagement tracking system, a way to incentive-align early and loyal fans, and accelerated capital formation to fund new initiatives. With megabrands like Nike, Gucci, McDonalds, and Starbucks all venturing into the space, this presents a $200 billion inevitable opportunity that will forever redefine how we connect with brands through the internet. There are serious challenges with the current state of onchain marketing technology. Onchain marketing initiatives require marketers to collect information like product feedback, mailing addresses, preferences, and social media accounts while validating certain token ownership or wallet activity. However, marrying online, onchain, and physical data requires significant engineering and data processing work. To make onchain marketing more accessible, DeForm is building a crypto-native CRM that allows marketers to ask personalized questions based on wallet activity, check for an individual’s onchain presence, give out crypto rewards like NFTs, and even establish lines of direct communication. All without developer intervention, while fighting bots and spam. You can use DeForm to: - build next generation signup forms, allowlists, and customer surveys - collect info, validate socials, wallets, transactions, tokens, and more... in seconds - obtain spam-resistant, bot-resistant, high quality responses only - engage your audience and nurture your community like never before - turn strangers into loyal fans with personalized questions and memorable gifts We’re proud to be already be working alongside industry-leading players like Coinbase, Alchemy, ENS, and Optimism to create seamless crypto-enabled marketing and community experiences.

Whether it’s because they are inaccurate, hallucinate, don’t work in real-world contexts, misunderstand real people or that they’re stuck before they start because of the “cold-start problem”, the issue comes down to not enough high-quality use-case specific, privacy-compliant labeled data for training. But real-world human-labeled data is expensive and requires a lot of data science labor – and synthetic data is so low-quality and unrelated to the model’s actual use-case that it doesn’t improve performance much. Nurdle can help. By using real-world human-labeled kernel datasets built for specific use-cases, we produce enhanced synthetic datasets that perform almost as well as human-labeled at the speed and price of synthetic datasets. Contact us for a free data gap analysis showing you what kind of data you’re missing and how much you need for your performance target.
